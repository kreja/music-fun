[00:00.00]Jewel - Stand
[00:12.22]
[00:14.22]Walk in a corner shop
[00:16.62]See a shoplifting cop
[00:18.58]See the old lady with a gun
[00:21.62]See the hero try 2 run
[00:23.73]Nothing's what it seems, I mean
[00:26.32]It's not all dirty, but it's not all clean
[00:29.17]There's children paying bills
[00:31.66]There's monks buying thrills
[00:33.78]There's pride for sale in magazines
[00:36.32]There's pills for rent 2 make u clean
[00:38.90]Marvin Gaye, there's no brother, brother
[00:41.48]Woody Guthrie's land can't feed Mother
[00:43.88]
[02:47.41][02:27.13][02:06.99][01:24.38][00:44.16]Mothers weep, children sleep
[02:49.62][02:29.52][02:09.39][01:26.76][00:46.40]So much violence ends in silence
[02:52.55][02:32.07][02:12.32][01:29.20][00:48.93]It's a shame there's no one 2 blame
[02:54.67][02:34.65][02:14.47][01:31.77][00:51.50]For all the pain that life brings
[02:57.56][02:37.44][02:17.32][01:34.21][00:54.30]If u will just take me It might just complete me
[03:02.72][02:42.60][02:22.67][01:39.90][00:59.67]And together we can make a stand
[03:06.48][02:47.04][02:26.49][01:43.97][01:03.85]
[01:04.58]A waitress brings me lunch
[01:07.01]We meet but do not touch
[01:09.08]On TV, D.C. is selling lies
[01:11.43]While in the corner, King's dream dies
[01:14.10]Go 2 the counter, pay for me and my friend
[01:17.03]A homeless man pulls out a roll, says it's on him
[01:20.11]The mayor has no cash
[01:21.22]He said he spent it on hookers and hash
[01:24.06]
[01:56.94][01:48.40]U will love me, I will love u
[02:06.41][01:56.43]
[03:07.98]
[03:10.53]END
